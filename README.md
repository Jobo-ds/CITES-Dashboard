## Data Visualization of International Trade of Endangered Species

### About:
The aim of this program is to provide a dashboard for data analysis of the CITES Trade Database, using SQL and Dash Plotly. The CITES Trade Database is a comprehensive database of millions of records spanning decades, that provide insight into a unique international market of trading of endangered species. The main feature of the dashboard is to provide a new exploratory technique based on volume and spatio-temporal visualization of relationships between importer and exporter countries as trade connections on a map view.

This project is in continued development, but based on work from my Master Thesis.
